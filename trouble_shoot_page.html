	    <p>Oh no! It seems that something went wrong with your cookie retrieval. Below you will find multiple quick fixes that can help you get your cookie to us.</p>

    </div>
    <p>1. Restart your browser and clear your browser cache and cookies. Sometimes refreshing your browser session can quickly solve the problem. Another great option is to try a different browser than the one you are currently using.</p>
    </div>
    <p>2. Make sure you are signed in with the correct Google account. Sometimes errors will occur if you try and retrieve a cookie from a google account that does not have Google Timelines setup. If you are in the correct account, make sure that you correctly set up Google Timelines by going back to the "New Participant Registration" Page and following the timeline setup instructions over there.</p>
